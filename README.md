# My Third Project: Cinemagic
This project is based on creating an app/a website that is focussed on showing users different movies made available to watch at Cinemagic cinemas. The goal of this project is to encourage as many users as possible to sign up with Cinemagic to book movie tickets for watching the films advertised and then return to leave their opinions about the films they watched. In addition, this project makes use of the CRUD operations. Users are able to create accounts with Cinemagic, read details about movies and other user’s reviews, update their bookings to make changes to certain features such as the number of tickets they wish to book, the location they want to watch the movie etc and delete their bookings if they change their mind on their movie choice.

# UX
This website/app is for anyone who is interested in watching movies and relies on the personal opinion of others when deciding what movies to watch. 
The user will want to achieve the ability to scroll through the movie options and have its details, posters and reviews immediately made available on the same landing page to help them make a decision, quickly on which movies to book tickets for. 
Using this project is the best way to achieve this as it has taken precaution to ensure all information about the movies were made available on the homepage and accessible to everyone regardless of whether or not they have set up an account with Cinemagic.

## User Stories 
* As a user of Cinemagic, I want to sign up to create an account, so that I can book tickets to watch one of the movies advertised by this company.
* As a user of Cinemagic, I want to create bookings of my movies of choice, so that I can document the: number of tickets, date of showing and location of the cinema I’ve requested.
* As a user of Cinemagic, I want to read the movie details and reviews of the offered movies, so I can make a more informed decision on which movie to select.
* As a user of Cinemagic, I want to read my booking information on my account, so I can be reminded of the: movie name, ticket quantity, showing date and location of the cinema I selected.
* As a user of Cinemagic, I want to be free to update my booking details on my account, so I can make changes to the: movie choice, ticket quantity, showing date and/or location of the cinema I selected if needed.
* As a user of Cinemagic, I want to be free to delete my bookings from my account, so I can declutter my account from unnecessary booking information resulting from having already seen the movie or changing my mind completely and deciding not to watch anymore.

## Designer Goals
* As the designer of Cinemagic, I want to create a sign up page that the user can be automatically directed to if they are not already logged in when trying to make a booking. I also want to ensure only a few relevant pieces of information are requested from the user when signing up, so the sign up process can be a quick and easy one to endure.
* As the designer of Cinemagic, I want to make the booking process appear on a modal whilst still on the homepage and then automatically direct the user to another page displaying all the information they just booked, so the user will have immediate access to their booking information for their reference.
* As the designer of Cinemagic, I want to organise the homepage to display the movie posters alongside their respective movie details and reviews centre-align with the user’s viewpoint, so obtaining information about the movies being offered will be made easier for them.
* As the designer of Cinemagic, I want to structure the user’s bookings page clearly with all the booked information placed in their correct sections and at the centre of the screen, so the user will easily be able to refer to their booked choices.
* As the designer of Cinemagic, I want to provide a fully functioning “change” button tailor made for each different set of bookings, so the user can simply press that button to edit the prefilled form of their current booking if they wish to make changes.
* As the designer of Cinemagic, I want to provide a fully functioning “delete” button tailor made for each different set of bookings, so the user can simply press that button to delete the respective movie booking they desire.
