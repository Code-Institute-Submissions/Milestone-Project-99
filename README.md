# My Third Project: Cinemagic
This project is based on creating an app/a website that is focussed on showing users different movies made available to watch at Cinemagic cinemas. The goal of this project is to encourage as many users as possible to sign up with Cinemagic to book movie tickets for watching the films advertised and then return to leave their opinions about the films they watched. In addition, this project makes use of the CRUD operations. Users are able to create accounts with Cinemagic, read details about movies and other user’s reviews, update their bookings to make changes to certain features such as the number of tickets they wish to book, the location they want to watch the movie etc and delete their bookings if they change their mind on their movie choice.

# UX
This website/app is for anyone who is interested in watching movies and relies on the personal opinion of others when deciding what movies to watch. 
The user will want to achieve the ability to scroll through the movie options and have its details, posters and reviews immediately made available on the same landing page to help them make a decision, quickly on which movies to book tickets for. 
Using this project is the best way to achieve this as it has taken precaution to ensure all information about the movies were made available on the homepage and accessible to everyone regardless of whether or not they have set up an account with Cinemagic.
